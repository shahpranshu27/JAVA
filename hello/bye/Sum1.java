    // the simple use case of package can be explained as, it is useful in managing the same named java files in different folders, who have different uses.
    // like for eg. sum1.java in b folder has different code, sum1.java in hello folder has different code/use, sum1.java in hello.bye folder has different use and so on. 
    // so, even though they have different uses, but same names, we can manage them by making different packages/folders
