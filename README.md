Hello fellow coders ðŸ‘‹, I have just started learning Java language ðŸ’», and here, in this repository, I'm gonna add the basic programs & projects that I am gonna make in Java, and track my progress.
I have also created notes while learning, and it's more like a cheat sheet, do give it a look in Notes folder.
